# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Model-VGG16

# Problem Statement:
Skin diseases, often invisible to the naked eye, pose significant challenges in diagnosis. Leveraging modern technology, particularly image classification techniques, can expedite the identification process by analyzing historical images of affected skin. This project aims to implement image classification in Python using machine learning models to swiftly recognize three common skin diseases: Nevus syndrome, melanoma, and Seborrheic keratosis. These diseases, caused by various factors, require prompt detection and treatment to mitigate their effects.

# Abstract:
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning models and image classification techniques to identify common skin diseases, including Nevus syndrome, melanoma, and Seborrheic keratosis. With the aid of historical images of affected skin, the goal is to develop a system capable of swiftly diagnosing these conditions, thereby improving healthcare outcomes. By implementing this solution in Python, utilizing libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, and employing the VGG16 model, we aim to provide an efficient and accurate method for derma disease detection.

# Dataset:
The dataset consists of images of three skin diseases: Nevus syndrome, melanoma, and Seborrheic keratosis. Each disease category includes separate folders for training, validation, and testing images. The dataset enables the training and evaluation of machine learning models for image classification tasks in dermatology.

# Methodology:
Data Preparation: Organize images into training, validation, and testing sets for each disease category.

Model Definition: Utilize the VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for image classification tasks.

Model Training: Train the VGG16 model on the prepared dataset to learn patterns and features associated with each skin disease.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Image Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new images, enabling swift and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases.
